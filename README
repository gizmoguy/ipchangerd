This is a simple script that monitors for IP address changes of configured
machines and then runs customisable actions for each machine when an IP
address change is detected.

Every 5 minutes ipchangerd is run via cron as root and as a result all down and
up scripts will also be run as root.

To configure ipchangerd first add the names of all machines to monitor for IP
changes to the names array in /etc/ipchangerd.conf. Then you can add a down
script to /etc/ipchangerd.d/ip-down.d/SERVERNAME which will be executed when
a machine loses its previous IP address, an up script can be added to
/etc/ipchangerd.d/ip-up.d/SERVERNAME which will be run when a machine gains a
new IP address. Replace SERVERNAME with the actual name of the server like
defined in ipchangerd.conf. Up and down scripts must have the executable bit
set to be executed by ipchangerd so simple remove the executable bit if you
to disable a particular script. The down and up scripts are both called with
the IP address they are working with on the first argument.
